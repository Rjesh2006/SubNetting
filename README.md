# SubNetting___
  *here is the easy  to understand definition of subnets:----*

  - A subnet, short for subnetwork, is a smaller, logically segmented portion of a larger network. 
    It's essentially a subdivision of a network created to improve its efficiency, security, and 
    manageability. Subnets are defined by using a subnet mask, which determines the range of IP 
    addresses that belong to the subnet.
    
    **Example:-for better understanding:-**
    
    - Think of a subnet like a neighborhood within a city. In a city, you have different 
      neighborhoods.
      each with its own characteristics, rules, and boundaries. Similarly, in a network, you have 
      subnets, each with its own range of IP addresses and characteristics. Subnets allow network 
      administrators to group devices together based on criteria such as location, function, or 
      security requirements, making it easier to manage and control traffic within the network.

      - *you can also go through with this images the flow creation of subnet mask :-*
